# What does knitr do, and why are we interested in using it as a tool?

* Knitr is a package in R that facilitates dynamic report generation.
* Dynamic report generation is desirable because it directly connects R (or other input languages e.g., python or awk) with their client-ready results
  * Meaning that if you have to change something, you don't have to write up a new deliverables document/report; the report itself is generated by the code and thus also updates when you change the code
  * Reports can be generated in a number of formats: html, pdf, LaTex, Markdown, etc.
  * Reports can even be made interactive using Shiny (`runtime: shiny` in the YAML header)

# How do I begin?

## Installing knitr
  * `install.packages("knitr")`

* By far the easiest way to use knitr is in conjunction with Rstudio
  * Fully integrated: option to create new .Rmd (R Markdown) file under 
  * Templates (can create your own wrapped in a package)
* From any R console
  * Construct your .Rmd file
  * `library(knitr)` 
  * `knit('./file-here.Rmd')`
  * `rmarkdown::render("<file path>")`
* From command line
  * `Rscript -e "library(knitr); knit('./file-here.Rmd')"`
  * [Something like this if you want to pass arguments] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17533359/how-can-i-use-command-line-arguments-with-knitr-source-file)

## Basic syntax
* YAML header
  * Contains information like project title, author, any parameters, toc options
* R Markdown text
  * syntax similar to other markdown formats (such as the one in which this was written)
* `opts_chunk` chunk
  * in which you set the default options for your chunks (e.g., `eval = TRUE`, `echo = FALSE`, `results = 'hide'`, `engine='python'`, etc.)
* Code can be separated into "chunks", and each chunk can be configured with it's own set of options (defaulting to those specified in the opt_chunk chunk)
   * ``` {r Chunk_title option1, option2, ...}
   * R code then goes in here
   * ``` when you're done

# Some of my favorite features so far

* Can configure .rmd document to take arguments
* Can create table of contents
* Can create templates (requires some more research, and possibly wrapping into a package)
* Apparently, you can render a whole collection of .Rmd files into a website all at once
